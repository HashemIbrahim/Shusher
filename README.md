## Introduction
Are you susceptible to waking up your neighbours late at night? Do you wish for an easy solution to keep your noise levels at a minimum? Well look no further! With the **Shusher**, a technical marvel at voice level detection, will you not only be able to easily visually detect when your noise levels are getting out of hand, but you are also able to say you finally made a worthwhile purchase. 

---
## Description
The **Shusher** visually warns a User for crossing a given noise level threshold. Lights ranging from green to red will display low to high audio levels respectively. This product will also turn on and off automatically at a desired time from a User.

## Purpose

The Shusher's main purpose is to be of great support to those in need of audio visualizers to be wary of how loud they are being. Whether you find yourself in a intense match of a video game, a heated debate over discord, or a book club on teams, having trouble volume control is an universal problem. 

This is where the Shusher comes in. Being composed of an ultrasonic ranger, a rgb light strip, and a microphone, the Shusher uses all these sensors to collaberatively detect and visualize how loud an user is. With addition of a GUI responding differently to your volume, the Shusher actively educates and warns the user on their current volume. This, hopefully, will keep a user's voice in check and consequentively save his/her neighbours from a loud disturbance in the area.
